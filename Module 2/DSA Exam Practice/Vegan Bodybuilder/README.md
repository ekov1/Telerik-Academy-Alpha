Each type of vegan meal has the following properties - **name**, **weight** and **protein** in grams. Pesho can eat maximum of **M** grams of food in total. You need to help him find from **N** foods, these **K** of them which have the maximum protein, but so that Pesho can eat them given their total weight.

Help Pesho become "nacepena vegan batka".
